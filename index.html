    <h2>Why Github</h2>
    <dl>
        <dd>
            <ol>
                <li>Github is used to save code and to share it with others. Suppose I want to save the code 
            so I can use it afterwards, I will use github repository.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Also, take another scenerio, if you are making an application, and there are hundreds of files and hundreds of programmers
            or developers are working there, so you would need git repository so everybody can access 
            same versions of file all the time. Every programmer will get same copy of the file. If new 
            programmers are added they do need to copy all stuffs or anything, they just need to run 
            few commands and they would have all the project in front of them. </li>
            <br>
            <li>It also helps us to track changes in our project. Consider, for example, our application was working fine, we just 
            added new feature and many functions behave weirdly, because of that. We can say bugs 
            appeared. If your application community is considerably high, then it would definitely
            create problem, so by using git we can revert back to the stabe version of application 
            easily and lunch the other one when bugs have been resolved. So git hve mutiple benefits. </li>

        <li>Install it with default options</li>
        <li>Now open your project folder where you are working, 
            run COMMAND PROMPT or GIT BASH there.</li>
        <li>Now, you need to add commands.</li>
